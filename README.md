# Movie-Trailer-Website
A Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers. 

## Installation
- 1. If necessary, install Python version 2.7.9
- 2. From the root /Movie-Trailer-Website directory, run entertainment_center.py in the command line
- 3. The program will open a browser windows and display the movie posters ready to be clicked for a movie trailer playback

## Examples
- 1. The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store movies, including movie title, box art URL and a YouTube link to movie trailers.

- 2. The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent movies

- 3. The Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of the movies.
